## Introduction to the Stedi Roadmap

This is the public roadmap for all Stedi products. Knowing about our upcoming products and priorities helps our customers plan and allows solicit feedback early from our users. This repository contains information about what we are working on, allows all Stedi customers to give direct feedback to our engineers, and for the community to engage with one-another.

[See the roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Stedi/projects/79)

## Issues v. Discussions

**Issues** in this repository are used to describe product and feature launches that are on the Stedi roadmap. The community is welcome to leave comments on specific Issues if you have questions about the specific product launch or feature.

**Discussions** in this repository are used for the community to surface feedback, discuss usability problems, propose new products, and ask questions. Feel free to engage with peers and answer questions directly.

## Security disclosures
If you think you've found a potential security problem, please do not create an Issue in the repo. Instead, please email [Stedi security](mailto:security@stedi.com) directly.

## Frequently asked questions

**Q: Why did you do this?**

We know that our customers are constantly making decisions on what to build, and we want to make sure they have visibility into our roadmap so they can make more informed decisions on what they decide to build. Additionally, sharing our roadmap publicly enables us to receive feedback early and often from the community.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

Dates are hard to predict, especially when security and operational stability are paramount to getting a product into the hands of developers. The published roadmap is subject to change at any time, and roadmap issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will be launched as proposed.

**Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?**

- **Researching:** we understand the problem that needs to be solved, and we are writing the preliminary docs, experiences, and API contracts
- **We're working on it:** we understand what and how it needs to be built, and code is being written
- **Developer preview:** the product is functional and in the hands of early beta users; breaking changes and instability are still a possibility; not for production use
- **Shipped:** otherwise known as "Generally Available," features and products that have Shipped are stable and ready for production use

**Q: How do you structure your issues?**

- Every issue will prefixed with the product name (e.g. [EDI Core])
- Every issue title will have the feature or product launch in it (e.g. Support for EDIFACT parsing)
- Every issue will be labeled with a product name (e.g. EDI Core)
- Every issue will be labeled with the category of launch (either Product Launch or Feature)

**Q: Is everything you are working on reflected in the roadmap?**

The vast majority of major features and product launches are available on the roadmap, but we do not include minor enhancements or bug fixes. Of course, there will be some projects we are very excited about that we will not put on the roadmap to surprise and delight the developer community.

**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**

If you want to ask a question or provide feedback, please open a [Discussion](https://github.com/Stedi/public-roadmap/discussions)! There are four categories of discussions: 
- **Announcements:** Stedi will use this to announce the launch of new features, or improvements to the roadmap
- **Bugs:** Customers can log bugs in this Discussion category and Stedi will respond to help and resolve
- **Electronic Data Interchange:** this is a forum for users to discuss specifics about EDI standards, specifications, and share industry knowledge
- **Ideas:** this is a forum for users to propose ideas and discuss how to build on Stedi
- **Q&A:** if you have a specific question for Stedi (or another member of the community) use this Q&A-style discussion

**Q: How do I contact Stedi directly?**
